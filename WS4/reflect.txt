For the part-3 of workshop 4, run() function and finding the first station in the constructor are so challenging for me.

In parts 1 and 2, Station and CustomerOrder modules helped me understand how inventory and orders work in simple way, giving me the basics for part 3.

For the run() function, to understand this function needed studying the tester file first, then realize that it runs in a while loop, explains why we need a static iteration counter to tracking multiple runs. Also, need to follow strict STL algorithm requirements.

For the constructor, I need to store the address of first station into the m_firstStation attribute, using for each iterates lambda, inside the lambda we find the current/first station using find_if, then find the next station if there have one more stations, and if the next station isn't the last one, point current to it. I use none_of checks for stations to find out which one is first stations by avoiding all the "next" stations. Like: current | next-1 next-1 | next-2 so I think the logic would be like this, looking for the station which didn't appear twice and the first station would never appear after "|".

Originally had issues with infinite loops and memory issues. Fixed by properly checking file opening with !File instead of file.empty(), and by initializing m_firstStation in constructor's init list.
